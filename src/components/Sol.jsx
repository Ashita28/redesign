        <p>Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic,
          and just has not been tried in the market. Once one initial company
          opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:
          For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built
          in Bangladesh for a family in need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime
          someone walks into a designer store and purchased an item, they are having
          to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly). <br />

          Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can extrapolate
          that to a Louie bag is a home burned. But just telling someone not to flex
          is not going to solve the problem. If we really want to win this war,
          we just need to sell higher status, for the same price.

          Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are
          set up showing customers videos of the harmed animals may not
          be a great way to connect with the target audience, and often
          cause a greater divide in mindsets.

          In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of
          luxury goods markets, sporting the aligned luxury merch.
          Rodeo drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer
          store not only has a shop, but theres a steady flow of customers.

          Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already
          massively viral amassing hundreds of millions of views
          interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a
          viral video and an ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new
          customers while kickstarting educating the world of the low status
          of wasteful spending now that a better alternative exists. </p>
